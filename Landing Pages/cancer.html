      <p> Cancer star sign,is all about home. These people love their<br>
          home and family more than anything else in this world.<br>
          Cancerians are blessed with strong intuitive and psychic powers that help them judge people well.<br>
          These people tend to be hard on the outside and soft inside.<br>
          But they also have a tougher side to their personality.
