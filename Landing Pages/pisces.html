      <p> Pisces is a watery sign, concerned with subtle emotions, and secret mystical depths.<br>
          They are likable and friendly yet can be very moody and introspective as well.<br>
          Pisceans are not entirely at home in this world.<br>
          They are dreamy and full of imagination, emotionally sensitive<br>
          and easily influenced by their environment.
