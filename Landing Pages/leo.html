      <p> The Leo is a natural leader of the Zodiac.<br>
          The natives are bold, intelligent, warm, and courageous.<br>
          Leo is an adventurer, seeking to balance an intense life of social obligations and<br>
          travel with plenty of downtime to relax and luxuriate.<br>
          There is a lot more to the Leo personality that isnâ€™t always apparent until you really get to know them.
